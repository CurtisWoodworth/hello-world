# hello-world
My first repository to be used for learning how to use git and GitHub.

So far in this tutorial I have made a new branch called readme-edits, which is a copy of the master branch.
Also, commits are saved changes. When I commit a new change I will add a commit message, explaining the purpose and result of what I changed.
